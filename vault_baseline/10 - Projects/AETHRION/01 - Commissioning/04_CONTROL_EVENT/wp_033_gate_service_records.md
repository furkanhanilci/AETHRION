## Package documents

This package is described by three documents. They are separate because they have three readers: this card is read at refinement by someone deciding whether the package can start; the test procedures are read months later by whoever runs them; the acceptance criteria are read by an **independent verifier** who must reach a verdict without having done the work — and `00_PROGRAM/06` requires that verifier to work from a packet they can be handed.

| Document | Answers | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **This card** | What is this, what does it depend on, what does it release? | Refinement, planning |
| [Test procedures](wp_033_gate_service_records.tests.md) | How is it tested, in what environment, with what data, and what counts as a complete run? | The implementer and the tester |
| [Acceptance criteria](wp_033_gate_service_records.acceptance.md) | What must hold for this to be `ACCEPTED`, and what does it still not establish? | The independent verifier |

## Purpose and expected outcome

A service deterministically evaluates gate artifact, policy, review, budget and blocker inputs and writes a `PASS` / `REVISE` / `REJECT` / `BLOCKED` / `DISAGREEMENT` outcome into the Temporal history.


## Analysis
### What this package actually decides

Whether a gate can say no. The verdict set — `PASS` / `REVISE` / `REJECT` /
`BLOCKED` / `DISAGREEMENT` — is the package's real content, and the two that
matter most are the ones a naive implementation omits: `BLOCKED` and
`DISAGREEMENT`.

`BLOCKED` is what ADR-001 requires for R3 under a solo operator — *declared rather
than waived*. `DISAGREEMENT` is what WP-018's conflicting verdicts open, and it
cannot resolve to `PASS` by majority.

### Verdict precedence is the whole safety property (T02)

Hard checks and soft checks produce different verdicts and they must not be
averaged. One failed hard check is `REJECT` regardless of how many soft checks
passed — the same asymmetry as WP-005's max/precedence and WP-006's dominance
rule, applied a third time.

A gate that computes a score is a gate that can be argued into passing.

### The explanation is what makes a `REVISE` actionable (T04)

A gate that returns `REVISE` with no list of failed checks has produced a
rejection the producer has to guess about. `PR-02`'s early signal is
*unexplainable decisions*, and it applies here as much as to policy: the verdict
must carry which checks failed and what would change them.

### Determinism matters for a different reason here than in WP-032

A gate evaluated twice on the same inputs must return the same verdict, because
the verdict goes into Temporal history and gets replayed. A gate that consults a
live registry mid-evaluation will replay differently and corrupt the history.
Inputs are snapshotted (T05), then evaluated.

### Baseline v1.3.0 — new policies at the gates, without moving authority

G0–G10 consumes the collaboration, conformance, assurance and reproduction
policies this baseline adds. **None of that moves authority.** Temporal still
owns lifecycle transitions and LangGraph still owns bounded cognition inside one
task, and a checkpoint in the second cannot transition a gate in the first.

Three concrete additions:

- **G5 and G6** consume the cohort, the topology, the specification conformance
  result and the assurance route.
- **G7** consumes the model execution fingerprint and the reproduction level it
  supports — a hosted black-box model does not yield `EXACT`.
- **G8** runs the human preliminary flow: the recommendation is unreachable
  until the human assessment is sealed, through **every** interface rather than
  only the UI.

And the write path becomes explicit: a canonical transaction and its outbox
record commit atomically, the publisher reads the outbox afterwards, and a
consumer validates identity and version rather than trusting a payload. The
failure suite gains the injections that make split brain visible — publisher
crash, duplicate delivery, out-of-order delivery, a cancelled task's late
result, and two concurrent gate transitions.

## Out of scope

- The internal implementation of any dependent package
- Production cutover and final operational approval

### Direct hard dependencies

4, each of which must be `ACCEPTED` — not `TECH_COMPLETE` — before this package is `READY`.

| Package | Supplies to this package |
|---|---|
| [WP-008 — G0–G10 Gate and Assurance Policy](../01_GOVERNANCE/wp_008_gate_policy_g0_g10.md) | `Gate Policy v1` · `Gate artifact matrix` · `Reopen/return transition table` · `Gate owner matrix` |
| [WP-016 — PolicyDecision, Control and Exception Schemas](../02_CONTRACTS/wp_016_policy_control_exception_contracts.md) | `PolicyDecision schema` · `ControlRecord schema` · `ExceptionRecord schema` · `Example decision fixtures` |
| [WP-018 — Claim, Evidence, Review and Decision Schemas](../02_CONTRACTS/wp_018_claim_review_decision_contracts.md) | `Evidence contract bundle` · `Claim state machine` · `Review/disagreement schemas` · `Decision schema fixtures` |
| [WP-032 — ProjectLifecycle Workflow Skeleton](../04_CONTROL_EVENT/wp_032_project_lifecycle_skeleton.md) | `ProjectWorkflow implementation` · `State transition table` · `Workflow API` · `Replay fixtures` |

### Full prerequisite closure

**30 of 160 packages (19%)** must reach `ACCEPTED` before this one can begin — the direct list above plus everything they in turn require. This is the number that determines when the package can actually start; the direct list is only its last layer.

| Level | Packages |
|---:|---|
| 1 | `WP-001` |
| 2 | `WP-002` |
| 3 | `WP-003` · `WP-005` · `WP-006` |
| 4 | `WP-004` · `WP-007` |
| 5 | `WP-008` |
| 6 | `WP-009` |
| 7 | `WP-010` |
| 8 | `WP-011` |
| 9 | `WP-012` · `WP-013` · `WP-016` |
| 10 | `WP-014` |
| 11 | `WP-015` · `WP-017` |
| 12 | `WP-018` |
| 13 | `WP-019` |
| 14 | `WP-020` |
| 15 | `WP-021` · `WP-022` |
| 16 | `WP-023` · `WP-025` · `WP-026` |
| 17 | `WP-024` · `WP-028` |
| 18 | `WP-027` |
| 19 | `WP-031` |
| 20 | `WP-032` |

### What acceptance of this package releases

- **Directly unblocked:** 7 — `WP-034` · `WP-035` · `WP-036` · `WP-038` · `WP-040` · `WP-091` · `WP-092`
- **Transitively reachable:** **82 of 160 packages (51%)** cannot be accepted until this one is.

The transitive figure is the leverage number. It does not appear anywhere else in the plan, and it is the one that should drive sequencing when two packages are otherwise equally ready.

### Position in the programme

| | |
|---|---|
| Wave | W3 — Control and runtime |
| Dependency depth | level **21** of 55 |
| On the documented critical path | no |
| Effort class | **M** |
| Accountable owner | Control Plane Lead |
| Independent verifier | Assurance Lead |
| Gates touched | `G0–G10` |
| Controls | `CTL-GOV-01` · `CTL-EPI-03` |

### Acceptance scenarios that exercise this package

**None.** No acceptance scenario names this package.

> `00_PROGRAM/11_scope_coverage_matrix.md` states the rule this trips: *a row with a primary package but no acceptance column is a capability nobody will ever be asked to demonstrate.* This package can reach `ACCEPTED` on its own tests, but it cannot reach `COMMISSIONED` through a scenario, because there is none to pass.

## Preconditions — Definition of Ready

- Dependencies accepted: [WP-008 — G0–G10 Gate and Assurance Policy](../01_GOVERNANCE/wp_008_gate_policy_g0_g10.md), [WP-016 — PolicyDecision, Control and Exception Schemas](../02_CONTRACTS/wp_016_policy_control_exception_contracts.md), [WP-018 — Claim, Evidence, Review and Decision Schemas](../02_CONTRACTS/wp_018_claim_review_decision_contracts.md), [WP-032 — ProjectLifecycle Workflow Skeleton](../04_CONTROL_EVENT/wp_032_project_lifecycle_skeleton.md)
- A named owner, a named implementer, and a verifier **independent of the producer** are assigned.
- Affected canonical records, interfaces and ADRs have been linked during refinement.
- `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified.
- The **acquisition surface is classified**: every part of this package is `DEPENDENCY`, `ADAPTER`, `OPTIONAL_BACKEND`, `STANDARD`, `BENCHMARK`, `PATTERN`, `DIRECT_ADAPT`, `ADAPTIVE_REIMPLEMENT` or `BUILD_NATIVE`, and every obligation the mode creates is resolved — see **Implementation acquisition and assimilation** above.
- Test fixtures, the environment, the rollback point and the acceptance measurement method are reachable.
- An O/M/P person-day estimate is recorded and real capacity is reserved against it.

## Execution requirements

<!-- generated:execution-requirements — produced by scripts/expand_packages.py; do not edit inside this block -->

### Inputs that must exist before the first task starts

Each row is a deliverable of a dependency. Its **absence is a stop condition**, not a risk to manage: work started against a missing input is work that will be redone against the real one.

| Required input | Comes from | Accepted? |
|---|---|---|
| `Gate Policy v1` | `WP-008` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-008` |
| `Gate artifact matrix` | `WP-008` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-008` |
| `Reopen/return transition table` | `WP-008` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-008` |
| `Gate owner matrix` | `WP-008` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-008` |
| `PolicyDecision schema` | `WP-016` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-016` |
| `ControlRecord schema` | `WP-016` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-016` |
| `ExceptionRecord schema` | `WP-016` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-016` |
| `Example decision fixtures` | `WP-016` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-016` |
| `Evidence contract bundle` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `Claim state machine` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `Review/disagreement schemas` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `Decision schema fixtures` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `PublicationAssertion` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `EvidenceTag` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `FindingRecord` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `Authority typing on every scientific record` | `WP-018` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-018` |
| `ProjectWorkflow implementation` | `WP-032` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-032` |
| `State transition table` | `WP-032` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-032` |
| `Workflow API` | `WP-032` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-032` |
| `Replay fixtures` | `WP-032` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-032` |

### Classification that must be recorded before work begins

`00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md` requires all four to be classified at refinement. They are not documentation: together they select the `ExecutionProfile`, and an unclassified package cannot be given one.

| Field | Must state | Recorded at refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `DataClass` | D0–D4 for every input and output this package touches | ☐ |
| `CodeTrust` | provenance of code this package executes | ☐ |
| `ToolEffect` | T0–T5; whether any external side effect occurs | ☐ |
| Network / credential scope | egress destinations and the identity used | ☐ |

### Capacity that must be reserved

- **Effort class `M`** — medium — a dedicated integration window.
- A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` person-day estimate, with `PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6`, is **mandatory** before this package is `READY`. It is not recorded here because it depends on real capacity at the time of refinement.
- **Control Plane Lead** carries the acceptance decision; **Assurance Lead** must verify independently of whoever implements.
- One owner holds at most two `IN_PROGRESS` packages. At least 25% of assurance capacity stays reserved for correction and re-verification.

### Evidence that must be producible before starting

A package whose evidence cannot be produced is not `READY`, however complete its design is. Confirm each is reachable:

- The target revision can be pinned, and every test result bound to it.
- An environment manifest can be captured for the environment the tests run in.
- The rollback or compensation path named in this document can actually be exercised.
- A signed `EvidenceManifest` can be issued — today via the interim profile `airl-interim-v0.1` (`scripts/evidence_manifest.py`), which is **tamper-evident and not externally witnessed**.
- The verifier can reach the evidence **without** seeing the producer's working trace.

## Implementation acquisition and assimilation

<!-- generated:implementation-sources — produced by scripts/expand_acquisition.py; do not edit inside this block -->

**What is already solved elsewhere, and on what terms.** Before the first task starts, an implementer has to know which parts of this package are called at runtime, which are copied and refactored, which are reimplemented from a specification, and which have no upstream at all. Those decisions are recorded in [`provenance/upstreams.json`](../../../provenance/upstreams.json) — mechanisms assimilated into this repository's own code — and in [`provenance/components.json`](../../../provenance/components.json) — components adopted at runtime. This block is derived from both, so a decision and the place it is used cannot drift apart.

### No registered source names this package

Neither register binds an upstream mechanism or a runtime component to `WP-033`, so every deliverable below is **`BUILD_NATIVE`**.

That is a statement about the registers, not a finding that no upstream exists. If refinement identifies one, it is recorded in the register **first** and appears here on the next generation — a component named in this document without a register entry is a defect that `scripts/check_wp_implementation_sources.py` reports.

| Source | Mode | What is taken | AETHRION owns | Unresolved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | `BUILD_NATIVE` | Everything not listed above: the contracts, the authority boundaries and the integration this package specifies | All of it | — |

**Acquisition readiness — nothing to resolve.** No acquisition obligation stands between this package and `READY`.

<!-- /generated:implementation-sources -->

## Implementation tasks

| Sub-task | Work to be done | Responsible | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-033-T01 | Write the gate evaluation input adapters | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-033-T02 | Apply hard and soft checks with an explicit verdict precedence | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-033-T03 | Emit separate records for gates that close within the same session | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-033-T04 | Produce a gate explanation and the list of failed checks | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-033-T05 | Bind reopen, supersession and the evidence snapshot | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |

## Mandatory deliverables

- `Gate Service`
- `GateRecord persistence`
- `Verdict rule tests`
- `Gate explanation format`
- An updated runbook or operations note, plus the service/contract ownership record
- A signed `EvidenceManifest`

## Test and verification plan

The outline below is the summary. The executable procedure — environment, data, coverage items, cases, execution log, incident and completion reports — is in [`WP-033_gate_service_records.tests.md`](wp_033_gate_service_records.tests.md).

- A hard-fail fixture for every gate
- A test proving risk depth still yields separate records
- Fail-closed behaviour on `UNKNOWN` policy or budget input
- Rejection of a stale input snapshot
- At least one negative test for unauthorised, missing, stale, duplicate and partial-failure inputs
- Producer/consumer contract compatibility tests on every affected interface
- Telemetry correlation and audit-record integrity checks

## Acceptance criteria

The programme-level conditions are below. The package-specific, measurable criteria — each with a threshold and the test case that decides it — are in [`WP-033_gate_service_records.acceptance.md`](wp_033_gate_service_records.acceptance.md), together with what this package still cannot establish.

- [ ] A gate outcome is not valid until it is written to the Temporal event history.
- [ ] A verdict carrying a critical blocker can never be `PASS`.
- [ ] Identical inputs and policy produce an identical verdict.
- [ ] All mandatory tests passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] No open Critical or High findings; no non-waivable blocker remains.
- [ ] The independent verifier has accepted the evidence package.
- [ ] Rollback/compensation behaviour has been exercised and audited.
- [ ] The related dashboard, alert, audit query or integrity query has produced working evidence.

## Acceptance evidence package

- Test results captured on the same target revision/digest
- An `EvidenceManifest` recording the environment, schema, policy and dependency versions
- The independent verifier's `ReviewRecord` or `VerificationRecord`
- The rollback/compensation trial and its result reference
- The list of open findings and residual risks with owners and expiry dates

## Risks and control points

- If a contract or canonical ownership question is unresolved, implementation **stops** and the question escalates to the Architecture Board.
- Identity, data routing, artifact integrity, independence and critical evidence problems **cannot** be passed by waiver.
- If a temporary manual control is required, its owner, scope, expiry, compensating control and removal package are recorded.
- A "package complete" statement is **not** acceptance. Without a verifier decision the package can only be `TECH_COMPLETE`.

### Workstream-specific hazards

- Any consumer that can change gate state creates dual authority over the workflow.
- At-least-once delivery means every consumer must be idempotent, without exception.
- A workflow change that breaks open executions is a data incident, not a deploy.

## Rollback / compensation

A faulty gate evaluation is corrected by a superseding record; the workflow is paused at its last safe state.

Immutable artifacts, reviews and decision history are **not** deleted during a rollback; the new state is expressed through a supersession or invalidation record.

## Handoff into downstream packages

On acceptance, the version and digest of every delivered artifact is written to the Package Registry, the dependency event is published, and every `READY` candidate blocked on this package is re-evaluated. A downstream package consumes **only** the contracts and evidence references listed above; it does not bind to internal implementation details.
