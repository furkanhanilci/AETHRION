# WP-129 — Quarterly DR, Supply-Chain and Audit Drill

## Package card

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Work package | `WP-129` |
| Workstream | `11_DAY2_OPERATIONS` |
| Initial effort class | **M** — medium — needs a dedicated integration window; a three-point (O/M/P) estimate is mandatory at refinement |
| Accountable owner | SRE Lead / Supply Chain Security |
| Independent verifier | Independent Audit Witness |
| Hard dependencies | WP-027, WP-059, WP-099, WP-114, WP-121 |
| Related gates | Day-2 |
| Related controls | CTL-OPS-02, CTL-OPS-03, CTL-SEC-05 |
| Related acceptance scenarios | — a Day-2 rhythm is exercised in operation, not as a go-live gate |
| Recurring counterpart of | ACC-17, ACC-27, ACC-40 — those scenarios verify the **initial** qualification before cutover; this package owns the **recurring** one afterwards |
| Status at baseline | `NOT_STARTED` |

## Package documents

This package is described by three documents. They are separate because they have three readers: this card is read at refinement by someone deciding whether the package can start; the test procedures are read months later by whoever runs them; the acceptance criteria are read by an **independent verifier** who must reach a verdict without having done the work — and `00_PROGRAM/06` requires that verifier to work from a packet they can be handed.

| Document | Answers | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **This card** | What is this, what does it depend on, what does it release? | Refinement, planning |
| [Test procedures](wp_129_quarterly_dr_supply_chain.tests.md) | How is it tested, in what environment, with what data, and what counts as a complete run? | The implementer and the tester |
| [Acceptance criteria](wp_129_quarterly_dr_supply_chain.acceptance.md) | What must hold for this to be `ACCEPTED`, and what does it still not establish? | The independent verifier |

## Purpose and expected outcome

Quarterly restore, workflow replay, signature and revocation, audit export and dependency/patch drills prove that the production baseline remains sustainable over time.


## Analysis
### What this package actually decides

That the guarantees established at commissioning are still true a year later.
Restore, replay, signature revocation, audit export and dependency hygiene —
rotated quarterly, because each of them decays in a different way and none of them
errors while decaying.

### Rotation matters more than repetition (T01)

Restoring the same component every quarter tests one path four times. Rotating —
different component, then a region, then the management plane — is what keeps
finding the dependency nobody documented.

### Replay is the guarantee most likely to have quietly broken (T02)

Every deployment since the last drill changed workflow code. `00_PROGRAM/01`'s
versioning requirement holds only if version markers were applied consistently, and
a marker missed six months ago fails on the first old execution that replays.

WP-040 runs replay in CI; this drill runs it against **real open executions**.

### Revocation is rehearsed because it is never exercised in normal operation (T03)

Signing works daily. Revoking a signature and observing what happens to running
workloads happens only when something is wrong — so it gets rehearsed here or it
gets learned during an incident.

### The full audit export with hash verification closes the record (T04)

WP-099's chain verified end to end, by the standalone verifier, over a real
project's full history. Any break is found here rather than by an auditor.

### Patch, CVE and ownership review is the boring half that decays fastest (T05)

Dependencies accumulate advisories. Owners change roles. Retention policies drift
from what the data classes require. None of it alarms.

### Baseline v1.3.0 — Day-2 measures what this baseline added

The recurring rhythms gain six subjects, each of which is a number that only
means something when tracked over time:

- **Multi-agent efficiency** — coordination overhead against the naive
  fully-connected baseline, and whether the optimisation still holds.
- **Verifier calibration** — precision, recall, **abstention rate** and error
  correlation between verifier families, requalified on a schedule.
- **Source and upstream drift** — pinned mechanisms whose upstream moved, and
  sources whose status changed.
- **Supply-chain posture** — OSV and Scorecard findings, and residual risks that
  reached their expiry.
- **Failure taxonomy distribution** — including how often attribution returned
  `UNKNOWN`, which is a system-health signal rather than a defect count.
- **The Pareto frontier** — quality against cost, so an optimisation that stopped
  paying is visible.

Incident learning consumes the typed `FailureAssessment` and retains negative
results. A failed approach that is deleted is a lesson the next campaign pays for
again.

## Out of scope

- The internal implementation of any dependent package
- Production cutover and final operational approval

### Direct hard dependencies

5, each of which must be `ACCEPTED` — not `TECH_COMPLETE` — before this package is `READY`.

### Full prerequisite closure

**122 of 160 packages (76%)** must reach `ACCEPTED` before this one can begin — the direct list above plus everything they in turn require. This is the number that determines when the package can actually start; the direct list is only its last layer.

### What acceptance of this package releases

- **Directly unblocked:** 1 — `WP-130`
- **Transitively reachable:** **1 of 160 packages (1%)** cannot be accepted until this one is.

The transitive figure is the leverage number. It does not appear anywhere else in the plan, and it is the one that should drive sequencing when two packages are otherwise equally ready.

### Position in the programme

| | |
|---|---|
| Wave | W9 — Day-2 |
| Dependency depth | level **54** of 55 |
| On the documented critical path | no |
| Effort class | **M** |
| Accountable owner | SRE Lead / Supply Chain Security |
| Independent verifier | Independent Audit Witness |
| Gates touched | `Day-2` |
| Controls | `CTL-OPS-02` · `CTL-OPS-03` · `CTL-SEC-05` |

### Acceptance scenarios that exercise this package

**None.** No acceptance scenario names this package.

> `00_PROGRAM/11_scope_coverage_matrix.md` states the rule this trips: *a row with a primary package but no acceptance column is a capability nobody will ever be asked to demonstrate.* This package can reach `ACCEPTED` on its own tests, but it cannot reach `COMMISSIONED` through a scenario, because there is none to pass.

## Preconditions — Definition of Ready

- Dependencies accepted: [WP-027 — Git, OCI Registry and Build Provenance Foundation](../03_FOUNDATION/wp_027_git_oci_supply_chain.md), [WP-059 — Supply-Chain Admission, Sigstore and SLSA Policy](../06_EXECUTION_SECURITY/wp_059_supply_chain_admission.md), [WP-099 — WORM Audit Ledger and Independent Export](../09_EXPERIENCE_OBSERVABILITY/wp_099_audit_worm_export.md), [WP-114 — Operations, DR and Restore Acceptance Package](../10_INTEGRATION_CUTOVER/wp_114_operations_dr_acceptance.md), [WP-121 — Hypercare, Stabilisation and Programme Closure](../10_INTEGRATION_CUTOVER/wp_121_hypercare_stabilization.md)
- A named owner, a named implementer, and a verifier **independent of the producer** are assigned.
- Affected canonical records, interfaces and ADRs have been linked during refinement.
- `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified.
- The **acquisition surface is classified**: every part of this package is `DEPENDENCY`, `ADAPTER`, `OPTIONAL_BACKEND`, `STANDARD`, `BENCHMARK`, `PATTERN`, `DIRECT_ADAPT`, `ADAPTIVE_REIMPLEMENT` or `BUILD_NATIVE`, and every obligation the mode creates is resolved — see **Implementation acquisition and assimilation** above.
- Test fixtures, the environment, the rollback point and the acceptance measurement method are reachable.
- An O/M/P person-day estimate is recorded and real capacity is reserved against it.

## Execution requirements

<!-- generated:execution-requirements — produced by scripts/expand_packages.py; do not edit inside this block -->

### Inputs that must exist before the first task starts

Each row is a deliverable of a dependency. Its **absence is a stop condition**, not a risk to manage: work started against a missing input is work that will be redone against the real one.

| `Program closure report` | `WP-121` | `python3 scripts/progress.py show WP-121` |

### Classification that must be recorded before work begins

`00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md` requires all four to be classified at refinement. They are not documentation: together they select the `ExecutionProfile`, and an unclassified package cannot be given one.

| Field | Must state | Recorded at refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `DataClass` | D0–D4 for every input and output this package touches | ☐ |
| `CodeTrust` | provenance of code this package executes | ☐ |
| `ToolEffect` | T0–T5; whether any external side effect occurs | ☐ |
| Network / credential scope | egress destinations and the identity used | ☐ |

### Capacity that must be reserved

- **Effort class `M`** — medium — a dedicated integration window.
- A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` person-day estimate, with `PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6`, is **mandatory** before this package is `READY`. It is not recorded here because it depends on real capacity at the time of refinement.
- **SRE Lead / Supply Chain Security** carries the acceptance decision; **Independent Audit Witness** must verify independently of whoever implements.
- One owner holds at most two `IN_PROGRESS` packages. At least 25% of assurance capacity stays reserved for correction and re-verification.

### Evidence that must be producible before starting

A package whose evidence cannot be produced is not `READY`, however complete its design is. Confirm each is reachable:

- The target revision can be pinned, and every test result bound to it.
- An environment manifest can be captured for the environment the tests run in.
- The rollback or compensation path named in this document can actually be exercised.
- A signed `EvidenceManifest` can be issued — today via the interim profile `airl-interim-v0.1` (`scripts/evidence_manifest.py`), which is **tamper-evident and not externally witnessed**.
- The verifier can reach the evidence **without** seeing the producer's working trace.

<!-- /generated:execution-requirements -->

## Implementation acquisition and assimilation

<!-- generated:implementation-sources — produced by scripts/expand_acquisition.py; do not edit inside this block -->

**What is already solved elsewhere, and on what terms.** Before the first task starts, an implementer has to know which parts of this package are called at runtime, which are copied and refactored, which are reimplemented from a specification, and which have no upstream at all. Those decisions are recorded in [`provenance/upstreams.json`](../../../provenance/upstreams.json) — mechanisms assimilated into this repository's own code — and in [`provenance/components.json`](../../../provenance/components.json) — components adopted at runtime. This block is derived from both, so a decision and the place it is used cannot drift apart.

### No registered source names this package

Neither register binds an upstream mechanism or a runtime component to `WP-129`, so every deliverable below is **`BUILD_NATIVE`**.

That is a statement about the registers, not a finding that no upstream exists. If refinement identifies one, it is recorded in the register **first** and appears here on the next generation — a component named in this document without a register entry is a defect that `scripts/check_wp_implementation_sources.py` reports.

| Source | Mode | What is taken | AETHRION owns | Unresolved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | `BUILD_NATIVE` | Everything not listed above: the contracts, the authority boundaries and the integration this package specifies | All of it | — |

**Acquisition readiness — nothing to resolve.** No acquisition obligation stands between this package and `READY`.

<!-- /generated:implementation-sources -->

## Implementation tasks

| Sub-task | Work to be done | Responsible | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-129-T01 | Select the rotating component or regional restore drill | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-129-T02 | Test open workflow replay and worker versioning | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-129-T03 | Exercise image, tool and policy signature and revocation | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-129-T04 | Run a full project audit export with hash verification | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-129-T05 | Review patch, CVE, backup, retention and ownership gaps | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-129-T06 | Close the drill findings and plan the next quarter | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |

## Mandatory deliverables

- `Quarterly drill dossier`
- `Restore/replay evidence`
- `Supply-chain/audit results`
- `Improvement backlog`
- An updated runbook or operations note, plus the service/contract ownership record
- A signed `EvidenceManifest`

## Test and verification plan

The outline below is the summary. The executable procedure — environment, data, coverage items, cases, execution log, incident and completion reports — is in [`WP-129_quarterly_dr_supply_chain.tests.md`](wp_129_quarterly_dr_supply_chain.tests.md).

- Rotating PITR, object, Temporal and NATS restores
- Denial of a revoked artifact
- Audit chain verification
- Owner and runbook execution
- At least one negative test for unauthorised, missing, stale, duplicate and partial-failure inputs
- Producer/consumer contract compatibility tests on every affected interface
- Telemetry correlation and audit-record integrity checks

## Acceptance criteria

The programme-level conditions are below. The package-specific, measurable criteria — each with a threshold and the test case that decides it — are in [`WP-129_quarterly_dr_supply_chain.acceptance.md`](wp_129_quarterly_dr_supply_chain.acceptance.md), together with what this package still cannot establish.

- [ ] RPO, RTO and integrity targets are met.
- [ ] An open critical drill finding escalates as a production risk, not merely as a cutover blocker.
- [ ] Every piece of evidence carries an independent witness.
- [ ] All mandatory tests passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] No open Critical or High findings; no non-waivable blocker remains.
- [ ] The independent verifier has accepted the evidence package.
- [ ] Rollback/compensation behaviour has been exercised and audited.
- [ ] The related dashboard, alert, audit query or integrity query has produced working evidence.

## Acceptance evidence package

- Test results captured on the same target revision/digest
- An `EvidenceManifest` recording the environment, schema, policy and dependency versions
- The independent verifier's `ReviewRecord` or `VerificationRecord`
- The rollback/compensation trial and its result reference
- The list of open findings and residual risks with owners and expiry dates

## Risks and control points

- If a contract or canonical ownership question is unresolved, implementation **stops** and the question escalates to the Architecture Board.
- Identity, data routing, artifact integrity, independence and critical evidence problems **cannot** be passed by waiver.
- If a temporary manual control is required, its owner, scope, expiry, compensating control and removal package are recorded.
- A "package complete" statement is **not** acceptance. Without a verifier decision the package can only be `TECH_COMPLETE`.

### Workstream-specific hazards

- Day-2 controls decay fastest because nothing fails when they stop running.
- Periodic work that stops silently is indistinguishable from periodic work with nothing to do.
- Operational evidence must keep being produced after go-live, or the assurance argument expires.

## Rollback / compensation

A drill is stopped on unexpected risk; the production blast-radius guard and the incident process take over.

Immutable artifacts, reviews and decision history are **not** deleted during a rollback; the new state is expressed through a supersession or invalidation record.

## Handoff into downstream packages

On acceptance, the version and digest of every delivered artifact is written to the Package Registry, the dependency event is published, and every `READY` candidate blocked on this package is re-evaluated. A downstream package consumes **only** the contracts and evidence references listed above; it does not bind to internal implementation details.
