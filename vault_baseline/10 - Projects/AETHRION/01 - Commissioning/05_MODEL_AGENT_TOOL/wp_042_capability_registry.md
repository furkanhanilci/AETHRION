## Package documents

This package is described by three documents. They are separate because they have three readers: this card is read at refinement by someone deciding whether the package can start; the test procedures are read months later by whoever runs them; the acceptance criteria are read by an **independent verifier** who must reach a verdict without having done the work — and `00_PROGRAM/06` requires that verifier to work from a packet they can be handed.

| Document | Answers | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **This card** | What is this, what does it depend on, what does it release? | Refinement, planning |
| [Test procedures](wp_042_capability_registry.tests.md) | How is it tested, in what environment, with what data, and what counts as a complete run? | The implementer and the tester |
| [Acceptance criteria](wp_042_capability_registry.acceptance.md) | What must hold for this to be `ACCEPTED`, and what does it still not establish? | The independent verifier |

## Purpose and expected outcome

For each model-snapshot × runtime-adapter combination, the admitted roles, data classes, tools, risk classes, evaluation evidence, cost, expiry and ejection state are held in a canonical registry.


## Analysis
### What this package actually decides

Which model may hold which role, and on what evidence. The registry is a
permission system whose subjects are model snapshots and whose objects are
research roles — and its most important property is that entries **expire**.

### The state machine is the package (T02)

`REGISTERED → SHADOW → ADVISORY → CONDITIONAL → MANDATORY`, with `SUSPENDED` and
`DISABLED` as exits. The progression encodes increasing trust earned by increasing
evidence, and the two exits are what make it revocable.

The state that matters most is `SHADOW`: the model runs alongside the incumbent,
its output is recorded and **not used**. Skipping shadow is how a model reaches
production on a benchmark score instead of on behaviour.

### Expiry is the control that ages correctly (T04)

A model qualified once stays qualified forever unless something forces
re-examination. Providers change models behind stable names; `00_PROGRAM/09`
already states that *a model alias change is not accepted as a pinned snapshot;
requalification is required.*

So the registry needs both: a scheduled expiry, and a trigger on any observed
fingerprint change.

### The open-task impact event is what makes ejection real (T05)

Disabling a profile changes nothing for work already running with it. Without an
impact event, an ejected model keeps producing results in flight, and those
results carry a profile that the registry now says is unfit — discovered, if ever,
during an audit.

This is `00_PROGRAM/01` invariant 7: a model snapshot change produces
requalification **and an explicit task impact assessment**.

### The registry is canonical, and that has a consequence

`00_PROGRAM/01`'s ownership table names the Capability Registry canonical for
model admission, with the router cache as a derivative. The cache must therefore
be rebuildable and must never be the place a decision is actually made.

### Baseline v1.3.0 — the Task Compiler stops emitting a skill list

This is the largest change in the model and agent layer, and it is a change of
kind rather than of size. The compiler's output was a skill bundle and a model
choice. It becomes the full execution shape of a task:

`AgentCohortRecord` · `CognitiveDiversityProfile` · skill bundles **by family** ·
`CommunicationTopology` · `ContextProjectionPolicy` · `ResearchBudgetContract` ·
`AssuranceRoute` · `ExecutionProfile` · `IndependenceProfile`.

A coding-science task compiles **both** skill families — preregistration
discipline beside test-driven development, scientific review beside code review
— without either aliasing the other (`ADR-012`).

Two other bindings:

- **Qualification records gain scope.** A verifier's qualification is keyed by
  verifier, version, task class, domain profile *and* threshold, and now also
  carries a model execution fingerprint and an abstention rate.
- **The Tool Broker gains a capability gate.** An action is unavailable unless
  policy grants it — not available-but-discouraged. Untrusted content can supply
  values and can never create an action, which is `ADR-003` enforced at the tool
  boundary rather than asserted at the prompt. Deterministic tool results are
  reusable within a declared freshness window and are marked as reused.

## Out of scope

- The internal implementation of any dependent package
- Production cutover and final operational approval

### Full prerequisite closure

**23 of 160 packages (14%)** must reach `ACCEPTED` before this one can begin — the direct list above plus everything they in turn require. This is the number that determines when the package can actually start; the direct list is only its last layer.

| Level | Packages |
|---:|---|
| 1 | `WP-001` |
| 2 | `WP-002` |
| 3 | `WP-003` · `WP-005` · `WP-006` |
| 4 | `WP-004` · `WP-007` |
| 5 | `WP-008` |
| 6 | `WP-009` |
| 7 | `WP-010` |
| 8 | `WP-011` |
| 9 | `WP-012` · `WP-013` · `WP-016` |
| 10 | `WP-014` |
| 11 | `WP-015` · `WP-017` |
| 12 | `WP-018` |
| 13 | `WP-019` |
| 14 | `WP-020` |
| 15 | `WP-021` |
| 16 | `WP-025` |
| 17 | `WP-041` |

### What acceptance of this package releases

- **Directly unblocked:** 7 — `WP-043` · `WP-044` · `WP-045` · `WP-047` · `WP-088` · `WP-108` · `WP-124`
- **Transitively reachable:** **113 of 160 packages (71%)** cannot be accepted until this one is.

The transitive figure is the leverage number. It does not appear anywhere else in the plan, and it is the one that should drive sequencing when two packages are otherwise equally ready.

### Position in the programme

| | |
|---|---|
| Wave | W3 — Control and runtime |
| Dependency depth | level **18** of 55 |
| On the documented critical path | no |
| Effort class | **M** |
| Accountable owner | Eval Office |

| Gates touched | `G1` · `G5` · `G10` |
| Controls | `CTL-MOD-01` · `CTL-MOD-02` |

### Acceptance scenarios that exercise this package

`COMMISSIONED` requires every scenario below to pass **on the same release candidate**. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a `Critical` row does not count as a pass.

| Scenario | Severity | What it must show |
|---|---|---|
| [ACC-36 — Model Snapshot Drift](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/acc_36_model_snapshot_drift.md) | Critical | The profile moves to suspension or requalification, the router cache is invalidated and an `ImpactScan` opens for open tasks, runs and claims; there is no unsafe fallback. |

### Inputs that must exist before the first task starts

Each row is a deliverable of a dependency. Its **absence is a stop condition**, not a risk to manage: work started against a missing input is work that will be redone against the real one.

### Classification that must be recorded before work begins

`00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md` requires all four to be classified at refinement. They are not documentation: together they select the `ExecutionProfile`, and an unclassified package cannot be given one.

| Field | Must state | Recorded at refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `DataClass` | D0–D4 for every input and output this package touches | ☐ |
| `CodeTrust` | provenance of code this package executes | ☐ |
| `ToolEffect` | T0–T5; whether any external side effect occurs | ☐ |
| Network / credential scope | egress destinations and the identity used | ☐ |

### Capacity that must be reserved

- **Effort class `M`** — medium — a dedicated integration window.
- A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` person-day estimate, with `PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6`, is **mandatory** before this package is `READY`. It is not recorded here because it depends on real capacity at the time of refinement.
- **Eval Office** carries the acceptance decision; **Model Platform Lead / Safety** must verify independently of whoever implements.
- One owner holds at most two `IN_PROGRESS` packages. At least 25% of assurance capacity stays reserved for correction and re-verification.

### Evidence that must be producible before starting

A package whose evidence cannot be produced is not `READY`, however complete its design is. Confirm each is reachable:

- The target revision can be pinned, and every test result bound to it.
- An environment manifest can be captured for the environment the tests run in.
- The rollback or compensation path named in this document can actually be exercised.
- A signed `EvidenceManifest` can be issued — today via the interim profile `airl-interim-v0.1` (`scripts/evidence_manifest.py`), which is **tamper-evident and not externally witnessed**.
- The verifier can reach the evidence **without** seeing the producer's working trace.

<!-- /generated:execution-requirements -->

## Implementation tasks

| Sub-task | Work to be done | Responsible | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-042-T01 | Build the `CapabilityProfile` persistence layer and API | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-042-T02 | Write the REGISTERED → SHADOW → ADVISORY → CONDITIONAL → MANDATORY / SUSPENDED / DISABLED state machine | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-042-T03 | Add the role, data, tool and risk eligibility query | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-042-T04 | Apply the expiry, requalification and ejection triggers | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-042-T05 | Bind the open-task impact event | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-042-T06 | Define the change and audit UI contract | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |

## Mandatory deliverables

- `Capability Registry service`
- `Profile state machine`
- `Eligibility API`
- `Expiry/revoke scheduler`
- An updated runbook or operations note, plus the service/contract ownership record
- A signed `EvidenceManifest`

## Test and verification plan

The outline below is the summary. The executable procedure — environment, data, coverage items, cases, execution log, incident and completion reports — is in [`WP-042_capability_registry.tests.md`](wp_042_capability_registry.tests.md).

- An expired profile being excluded from routing
- A suspended profile never used as a fallback
- A snapshot change forcing requalification
- Revocation raising an `ImpactCase` for open tasks
- At least one negative test for unauthorised, missing, stale, duplicate and partial-failure inputs
- Producer/consumer contract compatibility tests on every affected interface
- Telemetry correlation and audit-record integrity checks

## Acceptance criteria

The programme-level conditions are below. The package-specific, measurable criteria — each with a threshold and the test case that decides it — are in [`WP-042_capability_registry.acceptance.md`](wp_042_capability_registry.acceptance.md), together with what this package still cannot establish.

- [ ] No model-to-role assignment can be made outside the registry.
- [ ] A profile whose qualification period expires is suspended automatically.
- [ ] Every profile carries an immutable evaluation bundle reference.
- [ ] All mandatory tests passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] No open Critical or High findings; no non-waivable blocker remains.
- [ ] The independent verifier has accepted the evidence package.
- [ ] Rollback/compensation behaviour has been exercised and audited.
- [ ] The related dashboard, alert, audit query or integrity query has produced working evidence.

## Acceptance evidence package

- Test results captured on the same target revision/digest
- An `EvidenceManifest` recording the environment, schema, policy and dependency versions
- The independent verifier's `ReviewRecord` or `VerificationRecord`
- The rollback/compensation trial and its result reference
- The list of open findings and residual risks with owners and expiry dates

## Risks and control points

- If a contract or canonical ownership question is unresolved, implementation **stops** and the question escalates to the Architecture Board.
- Identity, data routing, artifact integrity, independence and critical evidence problems **cannot** be passed by waiver.
- If a temporary manual control is required, its owner, scope, expiry, compensating control and removal package are recorded.
- A "package complete" statement is **not** acceptance. Without a verifier decision the package can only be `TECH_COMPLETE`.

### Workstream-specific hazards

- A model alias is not a pinned identity; results obtained under an alias are not reproducible.
- An agent holding a credential defeats the entire broker design.
- Fallback routes are the least tested and most consequential path in this workstream.

## Rollback / compensation

A wrong profile is revoked; the router cache is invalidated and an impact scan runs, while historical run lineage is preserved.

Immutable artifacts, reviews and decision history are **not** deleted during a rollback; the new state is expressed through a supersession or invalidation record.

## Handoff into downstream packages

On acceptance, the version and digest of every delivered artifact is written to the Package Registry, the dependency event is published, and every `READY` candidate blocked on this package is re-evaluated. A downstream package consumes **only** the contracts and evidence references listed above; it does not bind to internal implementation details.
