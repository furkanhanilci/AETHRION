## How to read a criterion

<!-- generated:howto — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

A criterion belongs here only if it can **fail**. `00_PROGRAM/05` lists what is not evidence, and the first entry is an implementer's free-text declaration of success.

| A criterion states | Not |
|---|---|
| a number, a threshold or a command | "works correctly" |
| the observation that would falsify it | "has been reviewed" |
| the test case that decides it | "all tests pass" |
| what it does **not** establish | silence about its own limits |

Each criterion names the test case in [`WP-009_control_exception_catalog.tests.md`](wp_009_control_exception_catalog.tests.md) that decides it. A criterion with no test case cannot be verified, and a test case that decides no criterion is not part of acceptance.

## Package-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every control carries an owner, an enforcement point, a policy reference, a
      test, an evidence source, a review frequency and a current verdict.
- [ ] A control with **no evidence source reads as failing**, demonstrated by
      adding one and observing the verdict.
- [ ] control → policy → test → evidence resolves for every control; any broken
      link is listed as a finding rather than left blank.
- [ ] All nine control domains are populated — governance, epistemic, data,
      literature, security, operations, observability, cost, model.
- [ ] An exception with no approver is rejected; an expired exception **auto-revokes
      without human action**, and the exempted path is refused afterwards.
- [ ] Renewing an exception requires restating the **removal criterion**, not only
      a new expiry date.
- [ ] An exception against a non-waivable blocker is rejected and the attempt is
      audited.
- [ ] The non-waivable list has exactly one canonical owner; WP-008 references it
      rather than holding a second copy.
- [ ] Review frequency varies with consequence, and each frequency has a recorded
      rationale. A uniform cadence across all controls does not pass.
- [ ] At least one control-effectiveness review has produced a verdict **from
      observed evidence**.
- [ ] An independent reviewer searched for controls whose test cannot produce a
      failing result; each one found is recorded as a finding with a disposition.

## What this package cannot establish

> **The registry's own honesty metric.** The number of controls currently reading
> *failing* because they have no evidence. A registry reporting zero on its first
> effectiveness review has almost certainly defaulted to passing.

## Programme-level gates

<!-- generated:dod — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md`, instantiated for this package. Every line is a condition on **evidence**, not on effort.

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] The package purpose and its single delivery boundary are written.
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are written down.
- [ ] **Safety & Governance Owner** is assigned accountable; an implementer is named; **Internal Audit** is assigned verifier and is **independent of the producer** under WP-007's profile.
- [ ] `WP-005` — Research Risk and Assurance Profile — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-006` — ExecutionProfile and Route Policy — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-007` — IndependenceProfile and Separation-of-Duties Policy — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-008` — G0–G10 Gate and Assurance Policy — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified — all four, with no `UNKNOWN`.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria name **a number, a threshold or a command**. `00_PROGRAM/05` states that the generic template criteria are not measurable in the sense meant here; refinement is where that is fixed.
- [ ] Migration, rollback or compensation behaviour is defined.
- [ ] A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` estimate exists and capacity is reserved.

### Definition of Done — package acceptance

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion below passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] Test results are bound to artifact hashes and an environment manifest.
- [ ] **Internal Audit** verified **independently of the producer** and did not see the producer's working trace.
- [ ] Security, data and policy **negative** tests passed.
- [ ] Contract compatibility and downstream consumer tests are green.
- [ ] No open Critical or High finding. Accepted Medium/Low risks each carry a named owner and an expiry.
- [ ] Rollback or compensation was exercised at least once, and the result is referenced.
- [ ] Working evidence exists via a dashboard, alert or audit query — not only via a test log.
- [ ] The `EvidenceManifest` is signed and verifies, and its `limitations` list is present.

### Definition of Commissioned

An `ACCEPTED` package is still not production-ready. Every scenario below must pass **on the same release candidate**:

- [ ] `ACC-24` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-26` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.

## Non-waivable items

<!-- generated:nonwaivable — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/07_programme_risk_register.md`: *critical security, identity, evidence, reproduction and data blockers cannot be lowered by a numeric total.* The score exists for prioritisation; it is not a waiver mechanism.

The following cannot be waived on this package under any residual-risk acceptance:

- [ ] Identity and correlation failures.
- [ ] Data routing across a trust-zone boundary without policy.
- [ ] Artifact integrity or lineage loss.
- [ ] A reviewer independence violation.
- [ ] A missing or unverifiable `EvidenceManifest`.
- [ ] `CTL-GOV-03` failing its effectiveness test.

> A package with an open item above is `BLOCKED`, not `ACCEPTED with conditions`. The distinction is the reason the list exists.

<!-- /generated:nonwaivable -->

## Verifier's decision

Completed by the independent verifier, not by the producer. **Issuance is not acceptance** — a package that has produced evidence and has not been verified is `TECH_COMPLETE`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verifier | |
| Independence profile applied | R1 / R2 declared-partial / R3 — see ADR-001 |
| Dimensions **not** met | *(an R2 profile that lists only its strengths is not a declaration)* |
| Target revision verified | |
| Decision | `PENDING` / `ACCEPTED` / `REJECTED` |
| Date | |
| Conditions and their expiry | |
