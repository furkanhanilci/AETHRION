## How to read a criterion

<!-- generated:howto — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

A criterion belongs here only if it can **fail**. `00_PROGRAM/05` lists what is not evidence, and the first entry is an implementer's free-text declaration of success.

| A criterion states | Not |
|---|---|
| a number, a threshold or a command | "works correctly" |
| the observation that would falsify it | "has been reviewed" |
| the test case that decides it | "all tests pass" |
| what it does **not** establish | silence about its own limits |

Each criterion names the test case in [`WP-113_evidence_repro_acceptance.tests.md`](wp_113_evidence_repro_acceptance.tests.md) that decides it. A criterion with no test case cannot be verified, and a test case that decides no criterion is not part of acceptance.

## Package-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] **Both clean-room paths run**: a pass within pre-registered tolerance, and a
      **failure that marks the claim `CHALLENGED` and reopens G4/G5**. All six
      root-cause categories are exercised, and widening a tolerance after the result
      is refused.
- [ ] **Every derived index rebuilds byte-equivalently from canonical records**, and
      anything that does not return is reclassified as canonical with WP-012's matrix
      corrected.
- [ ] **Human notes in the generated Obsidian area survive projection**, an edit
      inside a generated fence is reported as drift rather than lost, and projecting
      twice with no change **rewrites nothing**.
- [ ] **Writing different bytes to an existing content address is refused at the
      storage layer**, including with the highest available credential — `PR-08`.
- [ ] Publication refuses separately on a missing certificate, an unresolvable
      citation and a protected locator.
- [ ] Supersession leaves the prior version reachable; nothing is withdrawn silently.
- [ ] **With no eligible reviewer the request is `BLOCKED` with the ADR-001
      declaration**, and forcing an ineligible reviewer through is refused.
- [ ] **A negative result is citable and produces a stop-or-pivot decision**, and
      discarding it is refused.

## What this package cannot establish

> **`ACC-38` will block, and blocking is the pass.** A solo laboratory has no
> external reviewer, so a scenario requiring one correctly reaches `BLOCKED` with a
> declaration. Reading that as a scenario failure — and finding a way to make it
> pass — is precisely the pressure ADR-001 exists to resist, and `PR-21` names the
> underlying condition: the programme assumes an organisation this laboratory does
> not have.

## Programme-level gates

<!-- generated:dod — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md`, instantiated for this package. Every line is a condition on **evidence**, not on effort.

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] The package purpose and its single delivery boundary are written.
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are written down.
- [ ] **Assurance Lead** is assigned accountable; an implementer is named; **Independent Reproducer / Citation Auditor** is assigned verifier and is **independent of the producer** under WP-007's profile.
- [ ] `WP-085` — Repeatability, Reproducibility, Robustness and Replication Pipeline — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-087` — Mechanical Verification Engine — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-088` — Blind, Cross-Family and Adversarial Review — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-089` — DisagreementCase and Evidence-Weighted Arbitration — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-090` — PublicationPackage, RO-Crate and Provenance Export — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-109` — Forty Acceptance Scenario Registry and Harness — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified — all four, with no `UNKNOWN`.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria name **a number, a threshold or a command**. `00_PROGRAM/05` states that the generic template criteria are not measurable in the sense meant here; refinement is where that is fixed.
- [ ] Migration, rollback or compensation behaviour is defined.
- [ ] A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` estimate exists and capacity is reserved.

### Definition of Done — package acceptance

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion below passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] Test results are bound to artifact hashes and an environment manifest.
- [ ] **Independent Reproducer / Citation Auditor** verified **independently of the producer** and did not see the producer's working trace.
- [ ] Security, data and policy **negative** tests passed.
- [ ] Contract compatibility and downstream consumer tests are green.
- [ ] No open Critical or High finding. Accepted Medium/Low risks each carry a named owner and an expiry.
- [ ] Rollback or compensation was exercised at least once, and the result is referenced.
- [ ] Working evidence exists via a dashboard, alert or audit query — not only via a test log.
- [ ] The `EvidenceManifest` is signed and verifies, and its `limitations` list is present.

### Definition of Commissioned

An `ACCEPTED` package is still not production-ready. Every scenario below must pass **on the same release candidate**:

- [ ] `ACC-19` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-30` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-31` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-38` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-39` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.

## Non-waivable items

<!-- generated:nonwaivable — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/07_programme_risk_register.md`: *critical security, identity, evidence, reproduction and data blockers cannot be lowered by a numeric total.* The score exists for prioritisation; it is not a waiver mechanism.

The following cannot be waived on this package under any residual-risk acceptance:

- [ ] Identity and correlation failures.
- [ ] Data routing across a trust-zone boundary without policy.
- [ ] Artifact integrity or lineage loss.
- [ ] A reviewer independence violation.
- [ ] A missing or unverifiable `EvidenceManifest`.
- [ ] `CTL-EPI-01` failing its effectiveness test.
- [ ] `CTL-EPI-03` failing its effectiveness test.
- [ ] `CTL-OPS-03` failing its effectiveness test.

> A package with an open item above is `BLOCKED`, not `ACCEPTED with conditions`. The distinction is the reason the list exists.

## Verifier's decision

Completed by the independent verifier, not by the producer. **Issuance is not acceptance** — a package that has produced evidence and has not been verified is `TECH_COMPLETE`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verifier | |
| Independence profile applied | R1 / R2 declared-partial / R3 — see ADR-001 |
| Dimensions **not** met | *(an R2 profile that lists only its strengths is not a declaration)* |
| Target revision verified | |
| Decision | `PENDING` / `ACCEPTED` / `REJECTED` |
| Date | |
| Conditions and their expiry | |
