# WP-090 — PublicationPackage, RO-Crate and Provenance Export

## Package card

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Work package | `WP-090` |
| Workstream | `08_EVIDENCE_ASSURANCE` |

| Accountable owner | Provenance Curator |
| Independent verifier | Citation Auditor / Safety / Archivist |
| Hard dependencies | WP-014, WP-018, WP-026, WP-072, WP-075, WP-077, WP-080, WP-081, WP-082, WP-085, WP-087, WP-088, WP-089 |
| Related gates | G9,G10 |
| Related controls | CTL-EPI-01, CTL-DAT-03, CTL-SUP-01 |

| Status at baseline | `NOT_STARTED` |

## Adopted component

> **Quarto/Pandoc authoring stack (provisional) · CSL · JATS · MECA · veraPDF**

The publication package is produced by an adopted authoring stack rather than a bespoke renderer: Quarto orchestrates, Pandoc's AST carries transformations, CSL supplies citation styles, JATS and MECA are interchange and submission exports, and veraPDF validates the rendered artifact when PDF/A or PDF/UA is requested. **A renderer exiting zero decides nothing** — publication remains a G9 human decision, and the authoring backend is provisional until the bake-off in `skills/authoring-research-documents/references/authoring-backend-bakeoff.md` is run.

Rationale and adoption type: `docs/architecture/AETHRION_COMPONENT_REUSE.md` §9.1.

## Package documents

This package is described by three documents. They are separate because they have three readers: this card is read at refinement by someone deciding whether the package can start; the test procedures are read months later by whoever runs them; the acceptance criteria are read by an **independent verifier** who must reach a verdict without having done the work — and `00_PROGRAM/06` requires that verifier to work from a packet they can be handed.

| Document | Answers | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **This card** | What is this, what does it depend on, what does it release? | Refinement, planning |
| [Test procedures](wp_090_publication_package.tests.md) | How is it tested, in what environment, with what data, and what counts as a complete run? | The implementer and the tester |
| [Acceptance criteria](wp_090_publication_package.acceptance.md) | What must hold for this to be `ACCEPTED`, and what does it still not establish? | The independent verifier |

## Purpose and expected outcome

Approved claims, limitations, source sets, protocols, runs, code/data/environment, reviews, reproductions and the `DecisionRecord` become a portable, signed and supersedable publication package.


## Analysis
### What this package actually decides

What leaves the laboratory. A `PublicationPackage` carries the claims, their
lineage, the sources, the protocols, the runs, the code, the data, the environment,
the reviews, the reproductions and the `DecisionRecord` — as one portable, signed,
supersedable object.

### RO-Crate because the format should outlive the system (T01)

`AETHRION_COMPONENT_REUSE.md` adopts **Workflow Run RO-Crate**. The reason is
specific: a package readable only by the system that produced it is not a
publication, and a laboratory that closes leaves its results unreadable.

Adopted, not invented — this package writes a profile, not a format.

### Supersession is what makes publication compatible with the loop (T06)

`AGENTS.md` §4.1: `VERIFIED` is explicitly not a permanent state, and the loop
closes. A publication that cannot be superseded forces the choice between a
permanent record and a correctable one — and `ACC-04`'s retraction impact scenario
needs the second.

The prior version stays reachable. Nothing is withdrawn silently.

### The release checks are three separate gates, not one review (T05)

- **Licence** — may this source's content be redistributed at all? (`PR-14`)
- **Privacy** — does the package contain personal data?
- **Security release** — does publishing reveal something the trust boundary
  protected: a dataset locator, an internal identifier, a prompt exposing an
  unpublished capability?

The third is the one that gets skipped, and it is the one a research laboratory is
least practised at.

### The narrative must materialise from the ledger, not beside it (T02)

If the prose is written independently and links are added afterwards, the links are
decoration. Materialising the claim narrative **from** the ledger means a sentence
without a claim cannot appear, which is what `evidence-before-claim` requires and
what WP-080's audit checks.

### The landing metadata is what makes the package findable and citable (T06)

A DOI, a persistent identifier, and an access statement. WP-138/WP-139 own the
deposit and the timestamp; this package produces what they deposit.

## Out of scope

- The internal implementation of any dependent package
- Production cutover and final operational approval

### What acceptance of this package releases

- **Directly unblocked:** 7 — `WP-095` · `WP-106` · `WP-107` · `WP-108` · `WP-109` · `WP-113` · `WP-138`
- **Transitively reachable:** **29 of 141 packages (21%)** cannot be accepted until this one is.

The transitive figure is the leverage number. It does not appear anywhere else in the plan, and it is the one that should drive sequencing when two packages are otherwise equally ready.

### Position in the programme

### Acceptance scenarios that exercise this package

`COMMISSIONED` requires every scenario below to pass **on the same release candidate**. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a `Critical` row does not count as a pass.

| Scenario | Severity | What it must show |
|---|---|---|
| [ACC-30 — Publication Completeness](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/acc_30_publication_completeness.md) | Critical | No publication package, signature or release is produced; G9 is FAIL/REVISE and a correction queue opens. Once the missing link is supplied, a new package version can pass. |
| [ACC-31 — Superseded Publication](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/acc_31_superseded_publication.md) | High | The old package stays reachable but is clearly marked superseded; the new package references its predecessor and the reason, and consumers receive an impact event. |
| [ACC-40 — Complete Project Audit Export](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/acc_40_audit_export.md) | Critical | The signed export verifies with complete correlation and hash chain; a missing or tampered fixture fails verification and raises an incident. |

### Classification that must be recorded before work begins

`00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md` requires all four to be classified at refinement. They are not documentation: together they select the `ExecutionProfile`, and an unclassified package cannot be given one.

| Field | Must state | Recorded at refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `DataClass` | D0–D4 for every input and output this package touches | ☐ |
| `CodeTrust` | provenance of code this package executes | ☐ |
| `ToolEffect` | T0–T5; whether any external side effect occurs | ☐ |
| Network / credential scope | egress destinations and the identity used | ☐ |

### Capacity that must be reserved

- **Effort class `L`** — large — split into sub-packages if the estimate exceeds the wave.
- A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` person-day estimate, with `PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6`, is **mandatory** before this package is `READY`. It is not recorded here because it depends on real capacity at the time of refinement.
- **Provenance Curator** carries the acceptance decision; **Citation Auditor / Safety / Archivist** must verify independently of whoever implements.
- One owner holds at most two `IN_PROGRESS` packages. At least 25% of assurance capacity stays reserved for correction and re-verification.

### Evidence that must be producible before starting

A package whose evidence cannot be produced is not `READY`, however complete its design is. Confirm each is reachable:

- The target revision can be pinned, and every test result bound to it.
- An environment manifest can be captured for the environment the tests run in.
- The rollback or compensation path named in this document can actually be exercised.
- A signed `EvidenceManifest` can be issued — today via the interim profile `airl-interim-v0.1` (`scripts/evidence_manifest.py`), which is **tamper-evident and not externally witnessed**.
- The verifier can reach the evidence **without** seeing the producer's working trace.

<!-- /generated:execution-requirements -->

## Implementation tasks

| Sub-task | Work to be done | Responsible | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-090-T01 | Write the `PublicationPackage` and RO-Crate profile and manifest | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-090-T02 | Build the claim narrative → ledger link materialiser | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-090-T03 | Bind the CSL citation, locator and audit results | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-090-T04 | Add the code, data, environment, run and reproduction artifact references | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-090-T05 | Apply the licence, privacy, redaction and release checks | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-090-T06 | Produce signature, archive, access, supersession and public landing metadata | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |

## Mandatory deliverables

- `Publication builder`
- `RO-Crate profile`
- `Signed publication package`
- `Release checklist`
- `Supersession record`
- An updated runbook or operations note, plus the service/contract ownership record
- A signed `EvidenceManifest`

## Test and verification plan

The outline below is the summary. The executable procedure — environment, data, coverage items, cases, execution log, incident and completion reports — is in [`WP-090_publication_package.tests.md`](wp_090_publication_package.tests.md).

- Failure when a critical claim has no locator
- Redaction of restricted data
- Package hash and signature verification
- An old link remaining accessible after supersession
- At least one negative test for unauthorised, missing, stale, duplicate and partial-failure inputs
- Producer/consumer contract compatibility tests on every affected interface
- Telemetry correlation and audit-record integrity checks

## Acceptance criteria

The programme-level conditions are below. The package-specific, measurable criteria — each with a threshold and the test case that decides it — are in [`WP-090_publication_package.acceptance.md`](wp_090_publication_package.acceptance.md), together with what this package still cannot establish.

- [ ] The narrative cannot change the certainty or limitations recorded in the ledger.
- [ ] The package carries complete lineage and its `DecisionRecord`.
- [ ] An older package is never deleted; it receives a supersession link.
- [ ] All mandatory tests passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] No open Critical or High findings; no non-waivable blocker remains.
- [ ] The independent verifier has accepted the evidence package.
- [ ] Rollback/compensation behaviour has been exercised and audited.
- [ ] The related dashboard, alert, audit query or integrity query has produced working evidence.

## Acceptance evidence package

- Test results captured on the same target revision/digest
- An `EvidenceManifest` recording the environment, schema, policy and dependency versions
- The independent verifier's `ReviewRecord` or `VerificationRecord`
- The rollback/compensation trial and its result reference
- The list of open findings and residual risks with owners and expiry dates

## Risks and control points

- If a contract or canonical ownership question is unresolved, implementation **stops** and the question escalates to the Architecture Board.
- Identity, data routing, artifact integrity, independence and critical evidence problems **cannot** be passed by waiver.
- If a temporary manual control is required, its owner, scope, expiry, compensating control and removal package are recorded.
- A "package complete" statement is **not** acceptance. Without a verifier decision the package can only be `TECH_COMPLETE`.

### Workstream-specific hazards

- Independence asserted in a record but not enforced by the router is decorative.
- A review that sees the producer's conclusion first is anchored, not independent.
- Reproduction that reuses the producer's environment reproduces the environment, not the result.

## Rollback / compensation

A pre-release fault marks the draft package `INVALIDATED`; a post-publication correction requires a new version, a supersession and an `ImpactCase`.

Immutable artifacts, reviews and decision history are **not** deleted during a rollback; the new state is expressed through a supersession or invalidation record.

## Handoff into downstream packages

On acceptance, the version and digest of every delivered artifact is written to the Package Registry, the dependency event is published, and every `READY` candidate blocked on this package is re-evaluated. A downstream package consumes **only** the contracts and evidence references listed above; it does not bind to internal implementation details.
