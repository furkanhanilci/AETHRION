## How to read a criterion

<!-- generated:howto — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

A criterion belongs here only if it can **fail**. `00_PROGRAM/05` lists what is not evidence, and the first entry is an implementer's free-text declaration of success.

| A criterion states | Not |
|---|---|
| a number, a threshold or a command | "works correctly" |
| the observation that would falsify it | "has been reviewed" |
| the test case that decides it | "all tests pass" |
| what it does **not** establish | silence about its own limits |

Each criterion names the test case in [`WP-088_blind_cross_family_review.tests.md`](WP-088_blind_cross_family_review.tests.md) that decides it. A criterion with no test case cannot be verified, and a test case that decides no criterion is not part of acceptance.

## Package-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] Each of the five reviewer roles has a rubric with a verdict domain and written
      anchors, and assignment follows the risk-based policy.
- [ ] Independence is enforced **at assignment and again at the gate**, and
      **two reviewers from the same model family are refused at R3** — the proxy for
      uncorrelated error.
- [ ] Reviewers receive the frozen package with **zero producer trace**.
- [ ] **Responses are sealed**: a reviewer cannot see another's verdict before
      submitting, and unsealing timestamps prove it.
- [ ] **Finding presentation order is randomised** with the seed recorded, removing
      the anchoring effect no rubric addresses.
- [ ] **The adversarial reviewer produces a falsification attempt, not an
      assessment**, and *failed to falsify* is recorded distinctly from *assessed as
      sound*.
- [ ] Aggregation preserves findings individually; **no majority vote produces a
      verdict**, and attempting one opens a `DisagreementCase`.
- [ ] Every finding references the claim and evidence span it concerns.
- [ ] Reviewer telemetry reports verdict distribution, agreement rate and **finding
      survival rate**, and a reviewer whose verdicts never vary is **flagged**.

## What this package cannot establish

> **Cross-family is a proxy and must be named as one.** Requiring different model
> families reduces the chance two reviewers share a failure mode; it does not
> measure it. The measurement is pairwise error correlation across the reviewer
> pool — `measuring-agreement`, WP-126, and an uncovered area in `00_PROGRAM/11`
> recorded as **PR-16**. Until it exists, every independence claim this package
> supports carries an unmeasured assumption, and the reviewer telemetry above is
> the closest available substitute.

## Programme-level gates

<!-- generated:dod — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md`, instantiated for this package. Every line is a condition on **evidence**, not on effort.

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] The package purpose and its single delivery boundary are written.
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are written down.
- [ ] **Assurance Lead** is assigned accountable; an implementer is named; **Independent Human Reviewer / Eval Office** is assigned verifier and is **independent of the producer** under WP-007's profile.
- [ ] `WP-007` — IndependenceProfile and Separation-of-Duties Policy — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-018` — Claim, Evidence, Review and Decision Schemas — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-042` — Capability Registry and Profile Lifecycle — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-043` — Role-Based Model and Skill Evaluation, and Golden Set Management — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-044` — Model Qualification and Admission Pipeline — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-045` — Policy Router and Minimum-Sufficient Model Package — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-047` — Role and Skill Registries, and the Task Compiler — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-077` — Claim State, Dependency and Assessment Engine — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-086` — Frozen and Blind Review Package Builder — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-087` — Mechanical Verification Engine — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified — all four, with no `UNKNOWN`.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria name **a number, a threshold or a command**. `00_PROGRAM/05` states that the generic template criteria are not measurable in the sense meant here; refinement is where that is fixed.
- [ ] Migration, rollback or compensation behaviour is defined.
- [ ] A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` estimate exists and capacity is reserved.

### Definition of Done — package acceptance

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion below passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] Test results are bound to artifact hashes and an environment manifest.
- [ ] **Independent Human Reviewer / Eval Office** verified **independently of the producer** and did not see the producer's working trace.
- [ ] Security, data and policy **negative** tests passed.
- [ ] Contract compatibility and downstream consumer tests are green.
- [ ] No open Critical or High finding. Accepted Medium/Low risks each carry a named owner and an expiry.
- [ ] Rollback or compensation was exercised at least once, and the result is referenced.
- [ ] Working evidence exists via a dashboard, alert or audit query — not only via a test log.
- [ ] The `EvidenceManifest` is signed and verifies, and its `limitations` list is present.

### Definition of Commissioned

An `ACCEPTED` package is still not production-ready. Every scenario below must pass **on the same release candidate**:

- [ ] `ACC-06` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-07` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-08` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-38` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.

## Non-waivable items

<!-- generated:nonwaivable — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/07_programme_risk_register.md`: *critical security, identity, evidence, reproduction and data blockers cannot be lowered by a numeric total.* The score exists for prioritisation; it is not a waiver mechanism.

The following cannot be waived on this package under any residual-risk acceptance:

- [ ] Identity and correlation failures.
- [ ] Data routing across a trust-zone boundary without policy.
- [ ] Artifact integrity or lineage loss.
- [ ] A reviewer independence violation.
- [ ] A missing or unverifiable `EvidenceManifest`.
- [ ] `CTL-GOV-02` failing its effectiveness test.
- [ ] `CTL-EPI-04` failing its effectiveness test.

> A package with an open item above is `BLOCKED`, not `ACCEPTED with conditions`. The distinction is the reason the list exists.

<!-- /generated:nonwaivable -->

## Verifier's decision

Completed by the independent verifier, not by the producer. **Issuance is not acceptance** — a package that has produced evidence and has not been verified is `TECH_COMPLETE`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verifier | |
| Independence profile applied | R1 / R2 declared-partial / R3 — see ADR-001 |
| Dimensions **not** met | *(an R2 profile that lists only its strengths is not a declaration)* |
| Target revision verified | |
| Decision | `PENDING` / `ACCEPTED` / `REJECTED` |
| Date | |
| Conditions and their expiry | |
