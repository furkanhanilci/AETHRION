## How to read a criterion

<!-- generated:howto — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

A criterion belongs here only if it can **fail**. `00_PROGRAM/05` lists what is not evidence, and the first entry is an implementer's free-text declaration of success.

| A criterion states | Not |
|---|---|
| a number, a threshold or a command | "works correctly" |
| the observation that would falsify it | "has been reviewed" |
| the test case that decides it | "all tests pass" |
| what it does **not** establish | silence about its own limits |

Each criterion names the test case in [`WP-023_git_worktree_branch_policy.tests.md`](WP-023_git_worktree_branch_policy.tests.md) that decides it. A criterion with no test case cannot be verified, and a test case that decides no criterion is not part of acceptance.

## Package-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] Branch and commit naming is enforced; an invalid name is refused.
- [ ] **Unsigned commits are refused.** Attribution is the base of every later
      independence claim.
- [ ] An agent worktree stays on its **pinned commit** when the upstream branch
      moves.
- [ ] A write outside the allowed-path manifest is refused **at the controller**,
      demonstrated once for each protected class — policy bundle, schema, CI
      configuration.
- [ ] A task description requesting wider scope does **not** widen the manifest;
      the attempt is audited. This is ADR-003 at the file layer.
- [ ] A freeze commit is recorded and immutable, and a correction branch starts
      from it rather than from `HEAD`.
- [ ] An abandoned task's worktree is **retained** under a forensic policy with a
      named expiry, and is removed automatically at that expiry with a log entry.
- [ ] Two concurrent agent tasks share no index and cannot observe each other's
      tree.

## What this package cannot establish

> **Not established here.** That the agent behaved well inside its scope. This
> package bounds what an agent *can* touch; whether what it did was correct is
> WP-060's adversarial territory and the review path in `08_EVIDENCE_ASSURANCE`.
> A tight scope makes a bad change small, not absent.

## Programme-level gates

<!-- generated:dod — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md`, instantiated for this package. Every line is a condition on **evidence**, not on effort.

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] The package purpose and its single delivery boundary are written.
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are written down.
- [ ] **Engineering Lead** is assigned accountable; an implementer is named; **Security Reviewer** is assigned verifier and is **independent of the producer** under WP-007's profile.
- [ ] `WP-022` — Repository Topology and Code Ownership — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified — all four, with no `UNKNOWN`.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria name **a number, a threshold or a command**. `00_PROGRAM/05` states that the generic template criteria are not measurable in the sense meant here; refinement is where that is fixed.
- [ ] Migration, rollback or compensation behaviour is defined.
- [ ] A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` estimate exists and capacity is reserved.

### Definition of Done — package acceptance

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion below passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] Test results are bound to artifact hashes and an environment manifest.
- [ ] **Security Reviewer** verified **independently of the producer** and did not see the producer's working trace.
- [ ] Security, data and policy **negative** tests passed.
- [ ] Contract compatibility and downstream consumer tests are green.
- [ ] No open Critical or High finding. Accepted Medium/Low risks each carry a named owner and an expiry.
- [ ] Rollback or compensation was exercised at least once, and the result is referenced.
- [ ] Working evidence exists via a dashboard, alert or audit query — not only via a test log.
- [ ] The `EvidenceManifest` is signed and verifies, and its `limitations` list is present.

### Definition of Commissioned

An `ACCEPTED` package is still not production-ready. Every scenario below must pass **on the same release candidate**:

- [ ] `ACC-54` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.

## Non-waivable items

<!-- generated:nonwaivable — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/07_programme_risk_register.md`: *critical security, identity, evidence, reproduction and data blockers cannot be lowered by a numeric total.* The score exists for prioritisation; it is not a waiver mechanism.

The following cannot be waived on this package under any residual-risk acceptance:

- [ ] Identity and correlation failures.
- [ ] Data routing across a trust-zone boundary without policy.
- [ ] Artifact integrity or lineage loss.
- [ ] A reviewer independence violation.
- [ ] A missing or unverifiable `EvidenceManifest`.
- [ ] `CTL-GOV-02` failing its effectiveness test.
- [ ] `CTL-SUP-01` failing its effectiveness test.

> A package with an open item above is `BLOCKED`, not `ACCEPTED with conditions`. The distinction is the reason the list exists.

## Verifier's decision

Completed by the independent verifier, not by the producer. **Issuance is not acceptance** — a package that has produced evidence and has not been verified is `TECH_COMPLETE`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verifier | |
| Independence profile applied | R1 / R2 declared-partial / R3 — see ADR-001 |
| Dimensions **not** met | *(an R2 profile that lists only its strengths is not a declaration)* |
| Target revision verified | |
| Decision | `PENDING` / `ACCEPTED` / `REJECTED` |
| Date | |
| Conditions and their expiry | |
