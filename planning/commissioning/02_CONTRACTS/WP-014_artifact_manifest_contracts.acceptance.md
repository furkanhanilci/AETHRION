## How to read a criterion

<!-- generated:howto — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

A criterion belongs here only if it can **fail**. `00_PROGRAM/05` lists what is not evidence, and the first entry is an implementer's free-text declaration of success.

| A criterion states | Not |
|---|---|
| a number, a threshold or a command | "works correctly" |
| the observation that would falsify it | "has been reviewed" |
| the test case that decides it | "all tests pass" |
| what it does **not** establish | silence about its own limits |

Each criterion names the test case in [`WP-014_artifact_manifest_contracts.tests.md`](WP-014_artifact_manifest_contracts.tests.md) that decides it. A criterion with no test case cannot be verified, and a test case that decides no criterion is not part of acceptance.

## Package-specific acceptance criteria

- [ ] Exactly one canonical content-address format, with the choice and its reason
      recorded. The existing `sha256:<hex>` versus bare-hex conflict is **resolved
      in code**, not documented as a known difference.
- [ ] Both `src/airl_bridge` and `src/airl_framework` emit the chosen format,
      closing the digest half of finding **H4**.
- [ ] Writing different bytes to an existing content address is **rejected**, and
      the rejection names the address.
- [ ] Superseding an artifact creates a new record, retains the prior one, and
      links them by lineage. Nothing is overwritten.
- [ ] `INVALIDATED` propagates **as a query result**: every dependent claim is
      reachable, and no downstream record's digest changes.
- [ ] Legal hold **overrides** retention — deletion under hold is refused after
      retention expiry.
- [ ] Object lock refuses deletion at the **storage layer**, not only in the
      application.
- [ ] A dataset split regenerates byte-identically from its manifest.
- [ ] Environments are pinned by OCI **digest and SBOM**; a mutable tag reference
      is rejected.
- [ ] Every source-representation artifact carries a licence field.

## What this package cannot establish

> **The decision this package must not defer.** The digest format. It is currently
> two formats in one repository, and every package downstream that compares an
> artifact hash inherits the ambiguity. Deferring it is how a schema conflict
> becomes a migration.

## Programme-level gates

<!-- generated:dod — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md`, instantiated for this package. Every line is a condition on **evidence**, not on effort.

### Definition of Ready

- [ ] The package purpose and its single delivery boundary are written.
- [ ] Out-of-scope items are written down.
- [ ] **Data Platform Lead** is assigned accountable; an implementer is named; **Reproducibility Engineer** is assigned verifier and is **independent of the producer** under WP-007's profile.
- [ ] `WP-011` — Identity and End-to-End Correlation Standard — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `WP-012` — Canonical Ownership and Field-Level Authority Matrix — is `ACCEPTED` (not `TECH_COMPLETE`).
- [ ] `DataClass`, `CodeTrust`, `ToolEffect` and the network/credential scope are classified — all four, with no `UNKNOWN`.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria name **a number, a threshold or a command**. `00_PROGRAM/05` states that the generic template criteria are not measurable in the sense meant here; refinement is where that is fixed.
- [ ] Migration, rollback or compensation behaviour is defined.
- [ ] A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` estimate exists and capacity is reserved.

### Definition of Done — package acceptance

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion below passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] Test results are bound to artifact hashes and an environment manifest.
- [ ] **Reproducibility Engineer** verified **independently of the producer** and did not see the producer's working trace.
- [ ] Security, data and policy **negative** tests passed.
- [ ] Contract compatibility and downstream consumer tests are green.
- [ ] No open Critical or High finding. Accepted Medium/Low risks each carry a named owner and an expiry.
- [ ] Rollback or compensation was exercised at least once, and the result is referenced.
- [ ] Working evidence exists via a dashboard, alert or audit query — not only via a test log.
- [ ] The `EvidenceManifest` is signed and verifies, and its `limitations` list is present.

### Definition of Commissioned

An `ACCEPTED` package is still not production-ready. Every scenario below must pass **on the same release candidate**:

- [ ] `ACC-23` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-58` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.
- [ ] `ACC-71` passes. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a Critical row does not count as a pass.

## Non-waivable items

<!-- generated:nonwaivable — produced by scripts/make_package_companions.py; do not edit inside this block -->

From `00_PROGRAM/07_programme_risk_register.md`: *critical security, identity, evidence, reproduction and data blockers cannot be lowered by a numeric total.* The score exists for prioritisation; it is not a waiver mechanism.

The following cannot be waived on this package under any residual-risk acceptance:

- [ ] Identity and correlation failures.
- [ ] Data routing across a trust-zone boundary without policy.
- [ ] Artifact integrity or lineage loss.
- [ ] A reviewer independence violation.
- [ ] A missing or unverifiable `EvidenceManifest`.
- [ ] `CTL-DAT-01` failing its effectiveness test.
- [ ] `CTL-SUP-01` failing its effectiveness test.

> A package with an open item above is `BLOCKED`, not `ACCEPTED with conditions`. The distinction is the reason the list exists.

## Verifier's decision

Completed by the independent verifier, not by the producer. **Issuance is not acceptance** — a package that has produced evidence and has not been verified is `TECH_COMPLETE`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Verifier | |
| Independence profile applied | R1 / R2 declared-partial / R3 — see ADR-001 |
| Dimensions **not** met | *(an R2 profile that lists only its strengths is not a declaration)* |
| Target revision verified | |
| Decision | `PENDING` / `ACCEPTED` / `REJECTED` |
| Date | |
| Conditions and their expiry | |
