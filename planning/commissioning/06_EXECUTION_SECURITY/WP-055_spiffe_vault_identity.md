## Package documents

This package is described by three documents. They are separate because they have three readers: this card is read at refinement by someone deciding whether the package can start; the test procedures are read months later by whoever runs them; the acceptance criteria are read by an **independent verifier** who must reach a verdict without having done the work — and `00_PROGRAM/06` requires that verifier to work from a packet they can be handed.

| Document | Answers | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **This card** | What is this, what does it depend on, what does it release? | Refinement, planning |
| [Test procedures](WP-055_spiffe_vault_identity.tests.md) | How is it tested, in what environment, with what data, and what counts as a complete run? | The implementer and the tester |
| [Acceptance criteria](WP-055_spiffe_vault_identity.acceptance.md) | What must hold for this to be `ACCEPTED`, and what does it still not establish? | The independent verifier |

## Purpose and expected outcome

Human, service, worker and sandbox actors use attested identity and short-lived, purpose-bound credentials instead of long-lived shared secrets.


## Analysis
### What this package actually decides

That there are no shared secrets. Attested workload identity plus short-lived,
purpose-bound credentials replaces the thing every system accumulates: long-lived
keys in environment variables that nobody can rotate because nobody knows what
would break.

### Attestation is what makes identity non-transferable (T02)

A password identifies whoever holds it. An attested SPIFFE identity identifies the
workload the platform observes — it cannot be copied into another pod and used
there, because the attestation is about the runtime, not about a secret.

That is the property `PR-05`'s independence claims eventually rest on: a reviewer
identity that could be assumed by the producer is not a separation.

### Purpose-bound is the second half and the easier one to drop (T03)

A short-lived credential that can do anything is still over-broad for the ten
minutes it lives. Binding the lease to a purpose — WP-049's `InvocationEnvelope`
already carries one — is what makes the blast radius match the task.

### The human decision binding is where this touches the research record (T04)

`00_PROGRAM/05` requires the verifier to be independent of the producer, and
WP-038 requires the decision Update to be authenticated. Both need the human's
identity to be bound to the decision at the moment it is taken, with MFA — because
a decision attributed to the wrong actor invalidates the independence claim it was
supposed to establish.

### Two-person break-glass (T06)

WP-021 designs the path; this package makes it require two. A single-operator
laboratory cannot always supply two people, and the honest response is the one
ADR-001 already models: **declare the gap** rather than quietly implement a
one-person break-glass and call it two.

## Out of scope

- The internal implementation of any dependent package
- Production cutover and final operational approval

### What acceptance of this package releases

- **Directly unblocked:** 12 — `WP-056` · `WP-057` · `WP-060` · `WP-061` · `WP-075` · `WP-084` · `WP-091` · `WP-096` · `WP-097` · `WP-099` · `WP-101` · `WP-135`
- **Transitively reachable:** **80 of 141 packages (57%)** cannot be accepted until this one is.

The transitive figure is the leverage number. It does not appear anywhere else in the plan, and it is the one that should drive sequencing when two packages are otherwise equally ready.

### Acceptance scenarios that exercise this package

`COMMISSIONED` requires every scenario below to pass **on the same release candidate**. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a `Critical` row does not count as a pass.

| Scenario | Severity | What it must show |
|---|---|---|
| [ACC-25 — Human Approval Forgery](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/ACC-25_human_approval_forgery.md) | Critical | The decision is rejected; gate state does not change and a security event and audit record are produced. A valid owner with MFA and an idempotent request passes as the counter-example. |
| [ACC-26 — Approval, Delegation and Exception Expiry](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/ACC-26_approval_expiry.md) | Critical | The authority is auto-revoked; new operations are denied and running tasks pause or are contained according to policy. There is no automatic extension or re-approval. |

### Inputs that must exist before the first task starts

Each row is a deliverable of a dependency. Its **absence is a stop condition**, not a risk to manage: work started against a missing input is work that will be redone against the real one.

### Classification that must be recorded before work begins

`00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md` requires all four to be classified at refinement. They are not documentation: together they select the `ExecutionProfile`, and an unclassified package cannot be given one.

| Field | Must state | Recorded at refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `DataClass` | D0–D4 for every input and output this package touches | ☐ |
| `CodeTrust` | provenance of code this package executes | ☐ |
| `ToolEffect` | T0–T5; whether any external side effect occurs | ☐ |
| Network / credential scope | egress destinations and the identity used | ☐ |

### Capacity that must be reserved

- **Effort class `L`** — large — split into sub-packages if the estimate exceeds the wave.
- A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` person-day estimate, with `PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6`, is **mandatory** before this package is `READY`. It is not recorded here because it depends on real capacity at the time of refinement.
- **Identity Platform Lead** carries the acceptance decision; **Security / Internal Audit** must verify independently of whoever implements.
- One owner holds at most two `IN_PROGRESS` packages. At least 25% of assurance capacity stays reserved for correction and re-verification.

### Evidence that must be producible before starting

A package whose evidence cannot be produced is not `READY`, however complete its design is. Confirm each is reachable:

- The target revision can be pinned, and every test result bound to it.
- An environment manifest can be captured for the environment the tests run in.
- The rollback or compensation path named in this document can actually be exercised.
- A signed `EvidenceManifest` can be issued — today via the interim profile `airl-interim-v0.1` (`scripts/evidence_manifest.py`), which is **tamper-evident and not externally witnessed**.
- The verifier can reach the evidence **without** seeing the producer's working trace.

<!-- /generated:execution-requirements -->

## Implementation tasks

| Sub-task | Work to be done | Responsible | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-055-T01 | Deploy the SPIRE server and agents and define the trust domain | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-055-T02 | Write the service and workload registration selectors | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-055-T03 | Establish the Vault auth methods, secret engines and lease policies | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-055-T04 | Bind human OIDC/MFA/RBAC and the decision actor binding | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-055-T05 | Add credential injection, rotation and revocation telemetry | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-055-T06 | Establish the two-person break-glass workflow | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |

## Mandatory deliverables

- `SPIRE/Vault deployments`
- `Identity registry mapping`
- `Lease policies`
- `Break-glass procedure`
- `Identity audit dashboard`
- An updated runbook or operations note, plus the service/contract ownership record
- A signed `EvidenceManifest`

## Test and verification plan

The outline below is the summary. The executable procedure — environment, data, coverage items, cases, execution log, incident and completion reports — is in [`WP-055_spiffe_vault_identity.tests.md`](WP-055_spiffe_vault_identity.tests.md).

- Denial on a wrong workload selector
- Denial of access under an expired lease
- Lease revocation on task cancellation
- Denial of a forged approval identity
- A break-glass audit trail
- At least one negative test for unauthorised, missing, stale, duplicate and partial-failure inputs
- Producer/consumer contract compatibility tests on every affected interface
- Telemetry correlation and audit-record integrity checks

## Acceptance criteria

The programme-level conditions are below. The package-specific, measurable criteria — each with a threshold and the test case that decides it — are in [`WP-055_spiffe_vault_identity.acceptance.md`](WP-055_spiffe_vault_identity.acceptance.md), together with what this package still cannot establish.

- [ ] No shared static production credential exists.
- [ ] Every lease carries a task, purpose and target scope.
- [ ] Every human decision is bound to a verified MFA context.
- [ ] All mandatory tests passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] No open Critical or High findings; no non-waivable blocker remains.
- [ ] The independent verifier has accepted the evidence package.
- [ ] Rollback/compensation behaviour has been exercised and audited.
- [ ] The related dashboard, alert, audit query or integrity query has produced working evidence.

## Acceptance evidence package

- Test results captured on the same target revision/digest
- An `EvidenceManifest` recording the environment, schema, policy and dependency versions
- The independent verifier's `ReviewRecord` or `VerificationRecord`
- The rollback/compensation trial and its result reference
- The list of open findings and residual risks with owners and expiry dates

## Risks and control points

- If a contract or canonical ownership question is unresolved, implementation **stops** and the question escalates to the Architecture Board.
- Identity, data routing, artifact integrity, independence and critical evidence problems **cannot** be passed by waiver.
- If a temporary manual control is required, its owner, scope, expiry, compensating control and removal package are recorded.
- A "package complete" statement is **not** acceptance. Without a verifier decision the package can only be `TECH_COMPLETE`.

### Workstream-specific hazards

- A control not exercised by a negative test is an assumption.
- Default-allow egress anywhere in the chain nullifies every other isolation control.
- Sandbox escape is tested by attempting it, not by reading the configuration.

## Rollback / compensation

A compromised identity or lease is revoked; affected workloads pause and an incident plus impact scan is opened.

Immutable artifacts, reviews and decision history are **not** deleted during a rollback; the new state is expressed through a supersession or invalidation record.

## Handoff into downstream packages

On acceptance, the version and digest of every delivered artifact is written to the Package Registry, the dependency event is published, and every `READY` candidate blocked on this package is re-evaluated. A downstream package consumes **only** the contracts and evidence references listed above; it does not bind to internal implementation details.
