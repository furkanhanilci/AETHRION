# WP-126 — Reviewer, Judge and Reproducer Calibration

## Package card

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Work package | `WP-126` |
| Workstream | `11_DAY2_OPERATIONS` |
| Initial effort class | **M** — medium — needs a dedicated integration window; a three-point (O/M/P) estimate is mandatory at refinement |
| Accountable owner | Assurance Lead |
| Independent verifier | Eval Office / Independent Human Reviewer |
| Hard dependencies | WP-007, WP-043, WP-085, WP-086, WP-087, WP-088, WP-089, WP-113, WP-121 |
| Related gates | G6,G7,Day-2 |
| Related controls | CTL-GOV-02, CTL-EPI-04 |
| Related acceptance scenarios | — a Day-2 rhythm is exercised in operation, not as a go-live gate |
| Recurring counterpart of | ACC-07, ACC-08, ACC-38 — those scenarios verify the **initial** qualification before cutover; this package owns the **recurring** one afterwards |
| Status at baseline | `NOT_STARTED` |

## Package documents

This package is described by three documents. They are separate because they have three readers: this card is read at refinement by someone deciding whether the package can start; the test procedures are read months later by whoever runs them; the acceptance criteria are read by an **independent verifier** who must reach a verdict without having done the work — and `00_PROGRAM/06` requires that verifier to work from a packet they can be handed.

| Document | Answers | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| **This card** | What is this, what does it depend on, what does it release? | Refinement, planning |
| [Test procedures](WP-126_assurance_calibration.tests.md) | How is it tested, in what environment, with what data, and what counts as a complete run? | The implementer and the tester |
| [Acceptance criteria](WP-126_assurance_calibration.acceptance.md) | What must hold for this to be `ACCEPTED`, and what does it still not establish? | The independent verifier |

## Purpose and expected outcome

Reviewer precision, disagreement, order/identity/verbosity bias, false positives, escaped defects and reproducer consistency are measured on a schedule against golden and counter-tests.


## Analysis
### What this package actually decides

Whether the laboratory's own reviewers are any good. This is the package that
closes — or at least measures — the largest unmeasured assumption in the whole
programme.

### `PR-16` is this package's reason for existing

*Independence is assumed, never measured.* `PR-05` addresses **paper** independence:
different human, different model family, different credential. It says nothing about
whether two genuinely different reviewers make **correlated errors** — and if they
do, every independence claim in the system is weaker than it reads.

`00_PROGRAM/10`'s go-live condition names it directly: *independence measured, not
assumed — pairwise error correlation measured for the reviewer pool.*

### Validated precision is the metric that matters (T03)

Not how many findings a reviewer raised. How many survived arbitration and
reproduction. A reviewer producing many findings that never survive is producing
noise that consumes the scarcest resource in the system.

Recall matters too and is harder: it needs **hidden counter-tests** — known defects
the reviewer was not told about.

### Three biases, each measurable (T02)

**Order** — does verdict change with finding order? WP-088 randomises; this measures
whether the randomisation was necessary.
**Identity** — does a reviewer's verdict change when they can infer the producer?
**Verbosity** — does a longer, more confident submission get an easier verdict?

The third is the one most specific to model reviewers and the least often tested.

### Blind leakage audit (T02)

WP-086 redacts. This measures whether the redaction held — by checking whether
reviewers' verdicts correlate with producer identity they should not have had.

### Reviewer profiles expire (T04)

Same discipline as model admission. A reviewer qualified once stays qualified
unless something forces re-examination, and reviewers drift for the same reasons
models do.

### Baseline v1.2.0 — verifiers are calibrated too, and separately

This package covers reviewers, judges and reproducers. **Verifiers** are added,
and their record is deliberately a different one.

A reviewer is a scientific role, measured on agreement, decision accuracy against
controls, confidence calibration and order effects. A verifier is a bounded check,
measured on precision, recall, specificity and false positive and negative rates
against a labelled evaluation set. The same model may serve both; the records stay
separate because they answer different questions.

`VerifierQualificationRecord` is keyed by **verifier + version + task type +
domain profile + threshold**. All five: citation entailment, method–code alignment
and novelty grading are different tasks, and a threshold change on the same
version invalidates the qualification, because the threshold is part of what was
measured.

**Independence is measured, not configured.** Two verifiers from different
providers may share training sources, prompt ancestry, retrieved evidence or a
misreading of a specification. Error correlation between verifier families is
tracked on shared control sets rather than inferred from the provider name.

### Baseline v1.3.0 — Day-2 measures what this baseline added

The recurring rhythms gain six subjects, each of which is a number that only
means something when tracked over time:

- **Multi-agent efficiency** — coordination overhead against the naive
  fully-connected baseline, and whether the optimisation still holds.
- **Verifier calibration** — precision, recall, **abstention rate** and error
  correlation between verifier families, requalified on a schedule.
- **Source and upstream drift** — pinned mechanisms whose upstream moved, and
  sources whose status changed.
- **Supply-chain posture** — OSV and Scorecard findings, and residual risks that
  reached their expiry.
- **Failure taxonomy distribution** — including how often attribution returned
  `UNKNOWN`, which is a system-health signal rather than a defect count.
- **The Pareto frontier** — quality against cost, so an optimisation that stopped
  paying is visible.

Incident learning consumes the typed `FailureAssessment` and retains negative
results. A failed approach that is deleted is a lesson the next campaign pays for
again.

## Out of scope

- The internal implementation of any dependent package
- Production cutover and final operational approval

### What acceptance of this package releases

- **Directly unblocked:** 2 — `WP-130` · `WP-155`
- **Transitively reachable:** **2 of 160 packages (1%)** cannot be accepted until this one is.

The transitive figure is the leverage number. It does not appear anywhere else in the plan, and it is the one that should drive sequencing when two packages are otherwise equally ready.

### Position in the programme

|---|---|
| Wave | W9 — Day-2 |
| Dependency depth | level **54** of 55 |
| On the documented critical path | no |
| Effort class | **M** |

| Gates touched | `G6` · `G7` · `Day-2` |
| Controls | `CTL-GOV-02` · `CTL-EPI-04` |

### Acceptance scenarios that exercise this package

`COMMISSIONED` requires every scenario below to pass **on the same release candidate**. A `SKIPPED` scenario on a `Critical` row does not count as a pass.

| Scenario | Severity | What it must show |
|---|---|---|
| [ACC-07 — Reviewer Order Bias](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/ACC-07_reviewer_order_bias.md) | High | A material order effect fails the profile's calibration; the reviewer is not admitted to a critical role, or is suspended from it. |
| [ACC-08 — Strong Counter-Test](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/ACC-08_strong_counter_test.md) | Critical | The majority vote does not override the test; the claim becomes `CHALLENGED`/`REJECTED`, a `DisagreementCase` opens and G6 does not pass. |
| [ACC-38 — Critical Reviewer Unavailable](../12_ACCEPTANCE_SCENARIOS/ACC-38_reviewer_unavailable.md) | High | Neither the producer, a self-review, nor an ineligible fallback is used; the gate is `BLOCKED` and a human scheduling/escalation item and a capacity signal are produced. |

### Inputs that must exist before the first task starts

Each row is a deliverable of a dependency. Its **absence is a stop condition**, not a risk to manage: work started against a missing input is work that will be redone against the real one.

### Classification that must be recorded before work begins

`00_PROGRAM/05_definition_of_ready_and_done.md` requires all four to be classified at refinement. They are not documentation: together they select the `ExecutionProfile`, and an unclassified package cannot be given one.

| Field | Must state | Recorded at refinement |
|---|---|---|
| `DataClass` | D0–D4 for every input and output this package touches | ☐ |
| `CodeTrust` | provenance of code this package executes | ☐ |
| `ToolEffect` | T0–T5; whether any external side effect occurs | ☐ |
| Network / credential scope | egress destinations and the identity used | ☐ |

### Capacity that must be reserved

- **Effort class `M`** — medium — a dedicated integration window.
- A three-point `O`/`M`/`P` person-day estimate, with `PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6`, is **mandatory** before this package is `READY`. It is not recorded here because it depends on real capacity at the time of refinement.
- **Assurance Lead** carries the acceptance decision; **Eval Office / Independent Human Reviewer** must verify independently of whoever implements.
- One owner holds at most two `IN_PROGRESS` packages. At least 25% of assurance capacity stays reserved for correction and re-verification.

### Evidence that must be producible before starting

A package whose evidence cannot be produced is not `READY`, however complete its design is. Confirm each is reachable:

- The target revision can be pinned, and every test result bound to it.
- An environment manifest can be captured for the environment the tests run in.
- The rollback or compensation path named in this document can actually be exercised.
- A signed `EvidenceManifest` can be issued — today via the interim profile `airl-interim-v0.1` (`scripts/evidence_manifest.py`), which is **tamper-evident and not externally witnessed**.
- The verifier can reach the evidence **without** seeing the producer's working trace.

<!-- /generated:execution-requirements -->

## Implementation tasks

| Sub-task | Work to be done | Responsible | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-126-T01 | Run the calibration set and hidden counter-tests periodically | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-126-T02 | Audit order swaps and blind/unblind leakage | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-126-T03 | Compute validated precision and recall, disagreement rates and triage time | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-126-T04 | Establish reviewer and reproducer profile expiry and suspension | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |
| WP-126-T05 | Correct rubrics, training and bundles, then requalify | Implementation owner | Commit / configuration / record reference |

## Mandatory deliverables

- `Calibration reports`
- `Reviewer capability decisions`
- `Bias/quality dashboard`
- `Improvement actions`
- `VerifierQualificationRecord`
- `Verifier and reviewer error correlation measurement`
- `Abstention-rate and error-correlation calibration`
- An updated runbook or operations note, plus the service/contract ownership record
- A signed `EvidenceManifest`

## Test and verification plan

The outline below is the summary. The executable procedure — environment, data, coverage items, cases, execution log, incident and completion reports — is in [`WP-126_assurance_calibration.tests.md`](WP-126_assurance_calibration.tests.md).

- Order bias
- Identity leakage
- A strong counter-test
- A false-positive reproducer
- A correlated miss across model families
- At least one negative test for unauthorised, missing, stale, duplicate and partial-failure inputs
- Producer/consumer contract compatibility tests on every affected interface
- Telemetry correlation and audit-record integrity checks

## Acceptance criteria

The programme-level conditions are below. The package-specific, measurable criteria — each with a threshold and the test case that decides it — are in [`WP-126_assurance_calibration.acceptance.md`](WP-126_assurance_calibration.acceptance.md), together with what this package still cannot establish.

- [ ] More reviewers is never assumed to mean higher quality.
- [ ] A calibration failure suspends eligibility for the critical role.
- [ ] Human and model reviewers are measured against the same evidence rubric.
- [ ] All mandatory tests passed **on the same target revision**.
- [ ] No open Critical or High findings; no non-waivable blocker remains.
- [ ] The independent verifier has accepted the evidence package.
- [ ] Rollback/compensation behaviour has been exercised and audited.
- [ ] The related dashboard, alert, audit query or integrity query has produced working evidence.

## Acceptance evidence package

- Test results captured on the same target revision/digest
- An `EvidenceManifest` recording the environment, schema, policy and dependency versions
- The independent verifier's `ReviewRecord` or `VerificationRecord`
- The rollback/compensation trial and its result reference
- The list of open findings and residual risks with owners and expiry dates

## Risks and control points

- If a contract or canonical ownership question is unresolved, implementation **stops** and the question escalates to the Architecture Board.
- Identity, data routing, artifact integrity, independence and critical evidence problems **cannot** be passed by waiver.
- If a temporary manual control is required, its owner, scope, expiry, compensating control and removal package are recorded.
- A "package complete" statement is **not** acceptance. Without a verifier decision the package can only be `TECH_COMPLETE`.

### Workstream-specific hazards

- Day-2 controls decay fastest because nothing fails when they stop running.
- Periodic work that stops silently is indistinguishable from periodic work with nothing to do.
- Operational evidence must keep being produced after go-live, or the assurance argument expires.

## Rollback / compensation

A failed reviewer profile is suspended; open reviews receive an impact assessment and reassignment.

Immutable artifacts, reviews and decision history are **not** deleted during a rollback; the new state is expressed through a supersession or invalidation record.

## Handoff into downstream packages

On acceptance, the version and digest of every delivered artifact is written to the Package Registry, the dependency event is published, and every `READY` candidate blocked on this package is re-evaluated. A downstream package consumes **only** the contracts and evidence references listed above; it does not bind to internal implementation details.
